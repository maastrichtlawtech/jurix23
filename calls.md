## Papers 

*Call for Papers of the 36th International Conference on Legal Knowledge and Information Systems (JURIX 2023)*

For more than 30 years, the JURIX conference has provided an international forum for research on the intersection of Law, Artificial Intelligence, and Information Systems, under the auspices of the JURIX Foundation for Legal Knowledge Systems.

JURIX is dedicated to exploring recent advancements, challenges, and opportunities of technologies applied to legal and para-legal activities. We invite submissions of original papers on legal information, legal knowledge systems, artificial intelligence and law, computational and socio-technical approaches to law, covering foundations, methods, tools, systems, interfaces, and applications. Papers should demonstrate added value, novelty of contribution and/or analysis, significance of the work, (formal) validity and/or proper evaluation.

Topics include, but are not limited to:

### I - Logics and Normative Systems

-   Computational theories of law 
-   Computational representations of legal rules and domain-specific languages (DSLs) for law 
-   Formal logics and computational models of legal reasoning and decision-making (e.g., argumentation, statutory, rule-based, case-based, evidential reasoning), including relevant concepts such as qualification, causation, responsibility 
-   Formal models of norms and norm-governed systems 
-   Knowledge representation, knowledge engineering, and ontologies in the legal domain 
-   Semantic web, open and linked data, mark-up languages for the legal domain 
-   Normative reasoning by autonomous agents; multi-agent systems: norm operationalization, norm emergence 
-   Computational methods for agent-based modelling for policy-making and norm-making 
-   Computational methods for negotiation, contract formation, dispute resolution 
-   Computational methods for preference aggregation and voting 
-   Computational methods for compliance-checking, authorization, auditing, and regulation 
-   Computational methods for AI and Data Governance 

### II - Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning

-  Argument mining on legal texts 
-  Machine learning methods and models for legal document classification, information retrieval, automatic summarization of legal text 
-  Machine learning methods and models in support to regulatory and contract drafting 
-  Natural language processing for legal text analysis, including law-specific standard NLP tasks (Named Entity Recognition, Semantic Role Labelling, Translation, etc.) 
-  Information extraction, information retrieval, text understanding (e.g. entailment) from legal data and texts 
-  Question-answering systems, chatbots, and dialog systems in the legal domain 
-  Network analysis applied to legal documents (statutory law, case law, jurisprudence) and legal data. 
-  Knowledge discovery, Causal discovery, and Process mining in the legal domain 
-  Recommender systems in the legal domain 

### III - Cognitive and Socio-Technical Systems

-  Cognitive computing and AI-enabled information systems for legal knowledge management (legal research and case management), legal data visualization, and decision support. 
-  Hybrid architectures (symbolic and sub-symbolic) in legal applications 
-  Human-computer interaction in legal applications 
-  Explainable AI for legal applications 
-  Fairness and bias mitigation in AI systems for legal practices 
-  Technical regulation of AI, data-sharing, information processing, and computing systems 
-  AI-enabled information systems improving access to justice and equal opportunities 
-  e-government, e-democracy, and e-justice 
-  AI applications in legal education and training 
-  Intelligent legal tutoring systems, intelligent support systems for forensics  

## Long, Short, and Demo Paper submission

The deadline for paper submission is **September 8th, 2023**, all over the earth. Abstract submission (September 1st) is recommended. Papers are to be submitted through the Easychair Conference Management System in PDF format: [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=jurix2023](https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=jurix2023)

All submissions should be formatted using the styles and guidelines in the IOS Press Instructions for Authors.

There are three categories of papers. Please indicate the category of your paper when you submit the paper to Easychair.

The conference proceedings will be published by IOS Press in their series Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence and Applications (FAIA). Papers are to be submitted in PDF format. The JURIX 2023 conference and submission links will be available soon. All submissions should be formatted using the styles and guidelines (https://www.iospress.com/book-article-instructions) in the IOS Press Instructions for Authors.

There are three categories of papers. Please indicate a category when you [submit your paper](https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=jurix2023).

### Long papers

These are reports of well-developed and original research. An accepted long paper scores well in terms of relevance, originality, technical quality, significance, literature review, presentation, reviewer’s confidence, and overall evaluation. These should not exceed 10 pages. A paper which is not accepted as a long paper may be recommended by reviewers as a short paper.

### Short papers

Authors can submit short descriptions of preliminary results or an innovative idea. These papers should not exceed 6 pages.

### Demo papers

Authors can submit short descriptions of a system. These papers should not exceed 4 pages. Authors of demo papers should be willing to share (a screencast of) the demo privately with the reviewers, if so requested.
