## Travelling to Maastricht 

We recommend to fly-in via one of the following airports (ordered by proximity): 
- Maastricht: there is a regular bus to Maastricht Centre.
- Eindhoven: there is a regular bus to Eindhoven train station, which in turn has regular trains to Maastricht Centre.
- Brussels (Zaventem): there is a train connection from Brussels-Airport-Zaventem to Maastricht Centre.
- Düsseldorf: the best connection is via taxi from Düsseldorf to Maastricht Centre, for example with [Maestax](https://www.maestax.nl/en/contact). Public transport is also possible but takes about 3 hours.
- Amsterdam (Schiphol): there is a train connection from Schiphol Airport to Maastricht Centre. 

After arriving at the central station of Maastricht you can take a taxi transfer, which will bring you in 10 minutes to the Faculty of Law. Another option is to walk which will take approximately 20 minutes.
