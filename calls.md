## Call for Papers 

For more than 30 years, the JURIX conference has provided an international forum for research on the intersection of Law, Artificial Intelligence, and Information Systems, under the auspices of the JURIX Foundation for Legal Knowledge Systems.

The purpose of the JURIX conference series is to foster scientific exchange between researchers, practitioners, students, dedicated to exploring recent advancements, challenges, and opportunities of technologies applied to legal and para-legal activities. We invite submissions of original papers on legal information, legal knowledge systems, artificial intelligence and law, computational and socio-technical approaches to law and other normative systems, covering foundations, methods, tools, systems, interfaces, and applications. Papers should demonstrate added value, novelty of contribution and/or analysis, significance of the work, (formal) validity and/or proper evaluation.

### Topics

Topics include, but are not limited to:

#### I - Logics and Normative Systems

- Computational theories of law
- Computational representations of legal rules and domain-specific languages (DSLs) for law
- Formal logics and computational models of legal reasoning and decision-making (e.g., argumentation, statutory, rule-based, case-based, evidential reasoning), including relevant concepts such as qualification, causation, responsibility
- Formal models of norms and norm-governed systems
- Knowledge representation, knowledge engineering, and ontologies in the legal domain
- Semantic web, open and linked data, mark-up languages for the legal domain
- Normative reasoning by autonomous agents; multi-agent systems: norm operationalization, norm emergence
- Computational methods for agent-based modelling for policy-making and norm-making
- Computational methods for negotiation, contract formation, dispute resolution
- Computational methods for preference aggregation and voting
- Computational methods for compliance-checking, authorization, auditing, and regulation
- Computational methods for AI and Data Governance
 
#### II - Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning

- Argument mining on legal texts
- Machine learning methods and models for legal document classification, information retrieval, automatic summarization of legal text
- Machine learning methods and models in support to regulatory and contract drafting
- Natural language processing for legal text analysis, including law-specific standard NLP tasks (Named Entity Recognition, Semantic Role Labelling, Translation, etc.)
- Information extraction, text understanding (e.g. entailment) from legal data and texts
- Question-answering systems, chatbots, and dialog systems in the legal domain
- Network analysis applied to legal documents (statutory law, case law, jurisprudence) and legal data.
- Knowledge discovery, Causal discovery, and Process mining in the legal domain
- Recommender systems in the legal domain

#### III - Cognitive and Socio-Technical Systems

- Cognitive computing and AI-enabled information systems for legal knowledge management (legal research and case management), legal data visualization, and decision support.
- Hybrid architectures (symbolic and sub-symbolic) in legal applications
- Human-computer interaction in legal applications
- Explainable AI for legal applications
- Fairness and bias mitigation in AI systems for legal practices
- Technical regulation of AI, data-sharing, information processing, and computing systems
- AI-enabled information systems improving access to justice and equal opportunities
- e-government, e-democracy, and e-justice
- AI applications in legal education and training
- Intelligent legal tutoring systems, intelligent support systems for forensics
 
### Submission and publication

The deadline for paper submission is **September 8th, 2023**, all over the earth. Abstract submission (September 1st) is recommended. All submissions should be formatted using the styles and guidelines in the [IOS Press Instructions for Authors](https://www.iospress.com/book-article-instructions) and prepared for single-blind peer review. Papers are to be submitted in PDF format through [Easychair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=jurix2023).

There are three categories of papers: long, short, and demo. Please indicate a category when you submit your paper.
- **Long papers**: reports of well-developed and original research. An accepted long paper scores well in terms of relevance, originality, technical quality, significance, literature review, presentation, reviewer’s confidence, and overall evaluation. These should not exceed 10 pages (including references). A paper which is not accepted as a long paper may be recommended by reviewers as a short paper.
- **Short papers**: (short) descriptions of preliminary results or an innovative idea. These papers should not exceed 6 pages (including references).
- **Demo papers**: (short) descriptions of a system. These papers should not exceed 4 pages (including references). Authors of demo papers should be willing to share (a screencast of) the demo privately with the reviewers, if so requested.

All papers must be original and not simultaneously submitted to another journal or conference. The conference proceedings will be published by IOS Press in their series [Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence and Applications](https://www.iospress.com/catalog/book-series/frontiers-in-artificial-intelligence-and-applications) (FAIA) as gold open access.

## Call for Workshops and Tutorials  

Besides the main conference track and the Doctoral Consortium, JURIX 2023 will host a number of workshops and tutorials related to the themes of the conference. We welcome proposals on topics related to AI and law, legal information, legal knowledge systems, and computational and socio-technical approaches to law, following the scope of the JURIX conference. 
Workshop and tutorial sessions are scheduled on December 18, 2023.

Workshops provide an informal setting that fosters an active exchange of ideas. Most workshops will follow the classical format of presentations of peer-reviewed papers followed by discussion, but other formats (e.g., challenges) and entirely new ideas are also welcome. All workshops should be interactive events with adequate time allocated to discussion. 

Tutorials enable attendees to familiarize themselves with results and advancements in various subjects related to AI and Law and related topics, on the level of both theory and technology. We will consider two types of tutorials: “standard” half­-day tutorials; 90-minute “spotlight” tutorials. Spotlight tutorials are meant to address emerging areas, techniques, methodologies and perspectives in specialized topics. Standard tutorials are meant to cover rather established areas of JURIX scope.

Note that in the case of multiple workshop/tutorial submissions on similar topics, you may be asked to merge your proposal with that of others.

The deadline for proposals is **September 8, 2023**.

### Workshop proposal guidelines

Workshop proposals must be submitted via e-mail to the Program Chair Giovanni Sileno ([g.sileno@uva.nl](mailto:g.sileno@uva.nl)) as a single PDF (max 5 pages) file containing the following information:
