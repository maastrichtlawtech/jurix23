## ALP 2023: Workshop on AI, Law and Philosophy 

These are exciting times for the field of AI & Law: at the same time we read that an AI system passes the bar exam, and also that lawyers submit computer-generated briefs to court---which turn out to be filled with legal bogus. In this workshop, we aim to take the time for philosophical reflection of where we stand and what can be expected. The workshop brings together enthusiastic young researchers and experienced experts interested in the interface between AI, law and philosophy. In this way, we aim to connect to the "computational legal theory" tradition in the field of AI and Law.

## AI4Legs-II: Second Workshop on AI for Legislation

Can the Law be written by GPT-4? Can the members of the parliament use ChatGPT for improving their knowledge of the society needs? Can the Law be converted into programming code using AI/ML and logic formulae without losing legal theory principles, legal linguistic expressivity, and Constitutional principles? Can the digital format of Law be equally valid and considered a legitimate Legal Source, and under which conditions? Can a whole Legal System –including its diachronic dimension – be managed in a digital manner by using knowledge Graphs, Semantic Web techniques, Legal ontologies, Logic theory? Can a such translation be made automatically executable using Smart Contracts and immediately enforceable? How to render the “Law as Code” to the common citizen in a simple, yet transparent and accountable manner? Can an explicit normative statement be expressed natively in code or in non-linguistic signs (e.g., icons)? Which principles are necessary in order to not compress the Rule of Law and Democratic principles? What new legal theory is needed for a deep digital transformation of the legislative process that produces a digital format of Law with an innovative generative and constitutive modality instead of converting text (logos) into code? How to produce Law in non-textual norms while preserving normativity? How to improve the legislative process using AI/ML for better regulation?

This workshop would like to discuss these challenging questions with interdisciplinary instruments coming from philosophy of law, Constitutional law, legal informatics including AI & Law, computational linguistics, computer science, HCI and Legal design. We intend also to discuss the state of the art of the most advanced applications of AI in support of the better regulation, law-making system, aims to find answers to these questions using.

## Doctoral Consortium

The Jurix 2023 Doctoral Consortium aims at promoting the exchange of ideas from PhD researchers in the area of Artificial Intelligence and Law, and at providing them an opportunity to interact and receive feedback from leading scholars and experts in the field. Specifically, the Consortium seeks to provide opportunities for PhD students to:
- obtain fruitful feedback and advice on their research projects;
- meet experts from different backgrounds working on topics related to the AI & Law and Legal Information Systems fields;
- have a face to face mentoring discussion on the topic and methodology of the PhD with an international senior scholar;
- discuss concerns about research, supervision, the job market, and other career-related issues.
To be eligible for the Consortium, a candidate must be a current doctoral student within a recognised university. Ideally, the candidate should have at least 12 months of work remaining before expected completion. The participants of the Doctoral Consortium are encouraged to register for and attend the main conference. The PhD student should be the sole author of the submission.
