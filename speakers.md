Jaap Hage is an emeritus professor of Legal Theory at Maastricht University. His research is focused on legal logic, with emphasis on the logic of rules, basic legal concepts (ontology of law), and social ontology. His publications include the following books: Reasoning with Rules (1997), Studies in Legal Logic (2005), and Foundations and Building Blocks of Law (2018).

**Piek Vossen**, *VU*

After 10 years in industry, Piek Vossen became full professor (2009) and established the Computational Linguistics and Text Mining Lab at the Vrij Universiteit (VU), where today 25 researchers study language models. His groundwork on cross-language conceptual modelling and interoperability led him to found the Global-WordNet-Association (GWA) for building WordNets in languages and connecting these through semantic graphs (2001). GWA addresses fundamental questions at scale: what words we use, what they stand for, and how they relate. He developed Dutch WordNet databases; today, WordNet reminisces in large language models (LLM) that automatically place words in semantic graphs. He built an LLM from Dutch medical notes with AUMC researchers for medical text classification. He coordinated numerous programmes creating news reading machines to reconstruct what happened in the world as event-centric knowledge graphs. Funded by the prestigious Spinoza price, he studied three foundations for language understanding: identity, reference, and perspective, resulting in the GraSP model as the “theory-of-mind” of robots communicating with people within the Hybrid Intelligence gravitation programme.
