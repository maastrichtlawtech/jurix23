<p style='padding-left:10%'><strong><em>ChatGPT: what it is, what it can do, cannot do and should not do</em></strong></p>
<p style='padding-left:10%; font-size:90%'>OpenAI has set a new standard by making complex AI tools and systems available to the general public through a natural language interface. No need to program complex systems, just ask your question or send your request to ChatGPT. In this presentation, I dive deeper into the workings of ChatGPT to explain what it can do and what it cannot do. Finally, I discuss its potential future as a technology solution: as Artificial General Intelligence or as natural language interface to technology.</p>

## Wednesday 20th December, afternoon (plenary)

13:30 - 14:30. **Keynote Speech** by **[Jaap Hage](https://jurix23.maastrichtlawtech.eu/speakers/#monday-18th-december-2023)**, professor in Legal Theory (Maastricht University).

<p style='padding-left:10%'><strong><em>Explainable Legal AI</em></strong></p>
<p style='padding-left:10%; font-size:90%'>With the increasing popularity of AI based on machine learning, the ideal that AI programs can explain their outputs becomes more difficult to realise. There is no reason why this would be different for legal AI. However natural the demand for explicability may seem, it is not at all obvious what precisely is asked for. There seem to be two kinds of explanation, which can ideally be combined but which in practice do not always go together. The one kind describes the process through which the explanandum came about, physically or – in the law – logically. The other kind is a tool to create understanding in the audience. Psychological research has shown that people are often not capable to explain their own behaviour in the first way, and that when they explain it in the second way, the explanation may very well be false. This has also be shown to hold for legal decisions. If naturally intelligent lawyers are not always capable of explaining their own decisions – but may be under the illusion that they are – should we then demand from AI legal decisions makers that they do what human legal decision makers often cannot do? What can we under these circumstances expect from the explanations that AI systems give of their legal decisions? For some, the answer may come as a surprise.</p>
