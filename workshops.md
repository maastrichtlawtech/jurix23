Besides the main conference track and the Doctoral Consortium, JURIX 2023 will host a number of workshops and tutorials related to the themes of the conference.

We welcome proposals on topics related to AI and law, legal information, legal knowledge systems, and computational and socio-technical approaches to law, following the scope of the conference (see https://easychair.org/cfp/jurix2023 for further information).

Workshop and tutorial sessions are scheduled on December 18, 2023.

Workshops provide an informal setting that fosters an active exchange of ideas. Most workshops will follow the classical format of presentations of peer-reviewed papers followed by discussion, but other formats (e.g., challenges) and entirely new ideas are also welcome. All workshops should be interactive events with adequate time allocated to discussion. 

Tutorials enable attendees to familiarize themselves with results and advancements in various subjects related to AI and Law and related topics, on the level of both theory and technology. We will consider two types of tutorials: “standard” half­-day tutorials; 90-minute “spotlight” tutorials. Spotlight tutorials are meant to address emerging areas, techniques, methodologies and perspectives in specialized topics. Standard tutorials are meant to cover rather established areas of JURIX scope.

Note that in the case of multiple workshop/tutorial submissions on similar topics, you may be asked to merge your proposal with that of others.

**The deadline for proposals is September 8, 2023**.
